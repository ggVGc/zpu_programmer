# ZPU Programmer

ZPU is an extremely limited microprocessor implemented by abusing modules on the [ZOIA](https://empresseffects.com/products/zoia).

This is very sloppy programmer and an example program for ZPU.
* Edit `programmer.js` to specify the midi port where ZOIA is listening.
* No UI available, run it in the browser and open the console.
* Reload the page to reprogram.
